### **Problem Statement**
As part of the assignment, you are required to explore IMDB dataset from Kaggle or an open-source repository of your choice. You will apply your knowledge of deep learning and PyTorch to develop a solution for a specific problem in the dataset. 
Use Azure ML Studio with Designer Pipelines for using Pre-Build components and Visualization of movie categories for recommendation system.

### **Steps for the Assignment**
1. **Dataset Collection**:
   - Choose a dataset from Kaggle or any open-source source. Ensure that the dataset is not overly complex and can be processed on a standard local machine.
   - Sample Dataset from kaggle is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)
   
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Analyze the dataset and preprocess the data to make it suitable for training (e.g., normalization, encoding, splitting).

3. **Model Building**:
   - Build a PyTorch-based deep learning model that solves the selected problem. You can use a simple neural network or experiment with architectures like CNNs or RNNs depending on your dataset.

4. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train your model, evaluate its performance, and present metrics like accuracy, loss, or other relevant metrics.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Include visualizations such as loss curves, accuracy trends, or sample predictions.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Document your findings, observations, and challenges in a concise report.
